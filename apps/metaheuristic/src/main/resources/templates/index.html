    <h2 class="title">Metaheuristic platform</h2>
    <p>
        Metaheuristic is an application which implements (or intended to) a Turing complete machine.
        The main use of MH is a management of distributed tasks. Right now there are two main areas where MH is being used:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>AI modelâ€™s hyper-parameter optimization purpose.</p>
            Each optimization is presented as Experiment. An Experiment consists of some Tasks. Tasks are created at Dispatcher and distributed to Processor. For evaluating a performance of models, metrics and other data are collected and evaluated later by Metaheuristic.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Batch processing.</p>
            Common usage of batch processing - split data, create tasks for processing each part of data, process Tasks, aggregate results
        </li>
    </ul>
